# Cleanup Summary - Experimental Modules Removed

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Experimental Modules
- ✅ Deleted `ultra_compact_encoder.rs` - Used outdated 3-word system
- ✅ Deleted `ultra_compression.rs` - Designed for multiaddress format  
- ✅ Deleted `balanced_encoder.rs` - Was already disabled
- ✅ Deleted entire `src/universal/` directory - Experimental 32-byte encoding

### 2. Cleaned Public API
- ✅ Removed exports: `UltraCompactEncoder`, `UltraCompactEncoding`
- ✅ Removed exports: `EncodingStrategy`, `UniversalEncoding`
- ✅ Removed exports: `BalancedEncoder`, `BalancedEncoding` (was commented)

### 3. Removed Test Binaries
- ✅ `check_word_quality.rs`
- ✅ `debug_aim_issue.rs`
- ✅ `test_aim_fix_validation.rs`
- ✅ `test_ultra_compression.rs`

### 4. Updated Test Infrastructure
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors in test files
- ✅ Removed multiaddress references from integration tests
- ✅ Created new `run_main_tests.sh` script
- ✅ Marked old `run_exhaustive_tests.sh` as deprecated

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- Main `FourWordAdaptiveEncoder` compiles and runs
- IPv4 encoding/decoding works perfectly (4 words)
- CLI tool `4wn` functions correctly
- 111 library tests pass
- No compilation errors

### Known Issues ⚠️
- IPv6 encoding/decoding has bugs (incorrect address preservation)
- Some integration tests fail due to IPv6 issues
- This is a pre-existing bug in the main encoder, not related to cleanup

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~5000 lines of experimental code
2. **Focused API**: Only production-ready modules exposed
3. **No Confusion**: Removed all 3-word system code
4. **Pure IP:Port**: No more multiaddress format code
5. **Better Maintainability**: Less code to maintain and test

## Next Steps

1. **Fix IPv6 Bug**: The IPv6 encoder has a serious bug that needs fixing
2. **Update Documentation**: Remove any remaining references to experimental modules
3. **Version Bump**: Consider bumping to 2.0.0 due to breaking API changes
